# Skill Diary Database
## Informational Stuff
The trainers of CODERS.BAY decided to let you write a documentation of what you have learned. 

Please keep this as your diary and write a short summary with code snippets and some theoretical topics daily in the last half an hour of the day.

Just to let you know this will be your personal reference book. 

You are going to have three GIT Repositories where you document your progress of the course.

In this Repository we are gonna collect all information of the database classes. 

I'm going to give you all reviews in the form of issues every week, where I'm going to review your documentary by the following criteria:
- code quality
- quality of content 
- totality of your documentation.

As it is a personal documentation the styling and structure is up to your personal preferences.
